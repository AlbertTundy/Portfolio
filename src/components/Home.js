                        My name is Stephen I am currently a student at the D.U. Full stack boot camp learning website design. As a former college drop out this is a big step for me. I've spent the last 10 years as a Shift supervisior at Starbucks where I've learned a lot but it's time for a change and this is a very interesting career path.

                <p>      What else is there to know about me? here are some highlights. When I was 19 I won a trip to Japan playing cards. I'm a former boyscout and I current Eagle Scout. I visited the twin towers in New York two months before 9/11 but my dad decided it was to expensive to go up. The lobby was pretty nice though. to see more attached is my <a className="linkcolor" href="https://github.com/AlbertTundy">github</a> and my <a className="linkcolor" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-pacyga-247b14202/">linkedin profile</a>.
